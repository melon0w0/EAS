// e.altKey, e.ctrlKey

Shading/lighten improvements

notes on difference between mouseEvent.button vs mouseEvent.buttons
e.button: 
    which button was pressed to initiate the event
    NOT which button was pressed during the event => not reliable for events such as mouseenter, mousemove, etc.
    left-button: 0,   right-button:2,

    downside: User may change their mouse configuration such that when the button on the left is pressed, e.button != 0;

e.buttons:
    the state of buttons pressed *during* any kind of mouse event
    //1 left click
    //2 right click
    //if multiple buttons are clicked, add the numbers up
